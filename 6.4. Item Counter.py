# 6.4. Item Counter
# Assume a file containing a series of names (as strings) is named names.txt and
# exists on the computerâ€™s disk. Write a program that displays the number of names that
# are stored in the file. (Hint: Open the file and read every string stored in it. Use a
# variable to keep a count of the number of items that are read from the file.)
